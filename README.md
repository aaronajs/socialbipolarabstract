#### Author: Aaron Suman

Source code for 4th year Individual Project.
This application requires Python 3.8.1 or above to run.

### Build and Run Instructions

1. Open Terminal Prompt.
2. Navigate to source folder, `sourcecode`.
    1. Create debate in a .txt file in the `debates` folder. Optionally create a .csv file with the corresponding votes with the same name as the .txt file.
    2. Or use an example debate already provided in the folder.
3. To execute the evaluation process, run: `python control.py <filename>`

For example: `python control.py sba`

The application process will be updated in the terminal interface, and a PDF file of the debate will be generated and opened upon completion.
